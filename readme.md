##Url-Shortener
URL-Shortener is a application that aims to change large URL's into small, tiny cute ones.
URL-Shortener uses PHP, the Laravel Framework and uses MySQL for datastorage. 

The goal of this project was the learn about the Laravel framework and if i could use it in other projects that use the PHP language. 
Going forward my aim with this project is to use it as a way to further learn the Laravel framework as well as bettering my knowledge of PHP. 

Additionally, i hope that this project helps someone else learn the PHP as well as Laravel.
